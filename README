Invincible Tools
================

A Bukkit Plugin that allows invincible tools as configured by the server admins.

The config file is located in 'plugins\InvincibleTools' and is called 'config.yml'.
If the config file does not exist when the plugin is loaded, then one will be created
with unbreakable stone tools as the default. The only item in the config file is
invincible: followed by any of the following options separated by commas

Options are:
  [material_type]		- Every one of the following tools made out of [material]
  						  including the sword

  [material_type]_tools	- Every one of the following tools made out of [material]
						  except the sword

  [material_type]_hoe
  [material_type]_spade
  [material_type]_axe
  [material_type]_pickaxe
  [material_type]_sword
  

[material_type] Can be any of the following:
  wood
  stone
  iron
  gold
  diamond

Example:
invincible: stone_pickaxe, diamond, wood_sword, iron_tools

That example would make stone pickaxes invincible, along with all diamond tools
including the diamond sword, along with wood swords, and all iron tools excluding
the iron sword.
